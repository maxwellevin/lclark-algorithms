Final code for FallingSand and FallingSandModel. This is a simple 2D game that allows a user to select a particle to draw with (sand, water, metal, mercury, or lava) and simulate its behavior. Created by Maxwell Levin and Journie Ma-Johnson for a Computer Algorithms class at Lewis & Clark College. 


Notes: 
        Uses Stdlib.jar. Make sure you have included this in your build path for this project. 
        MODEL_SIZE in FallingSandModel.java is set to 200 by default. For higher resolution screens it is recommended to use ~100
        SPEED in FallingSand.java is set to 1000 by default. If you decrease MODEL_SIZE, it is recommended to decrease SPEED also.
